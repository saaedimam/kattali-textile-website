You are Replit AI acting as a full-stack creative web team (designer + developer + illustrator).  
Your task is to **build and polish a futuristic landing + corporate website** for **Kattali Textile Ltd. (KTL)**, a Bangladesh-based textile manufacturing company.  
Use only **Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (no frameworks).  

================================================================
📌 COMPANY INFO (for context, copy into About/Content)
- Name: Kattali Textile Ltd.
- Location: Chattogram, Bangladesh
- Factory Capacity: 12 production lines, 850+ workers

- Mission: Ethical, sustainable, high-quality garment manufacturing for global buyers.
================================================================

🎯 GOALS
1. Create a **futuristic, animated, and interactive** corporate site.
2. Landing page should be **visually stunning** with **illustrated hero + animated textile graphics**.
3. Each section should recommend **illustration/background asset ideas** (so I can later generate images in MidJourney/Leonardo).
4. Include **stairs menu style (from uploaded ref)** + futuristic effects (liquid nav, spotlight cursor, blob dividers, 3D tilt cards, glowing charts, confetti on forms).
5. Must be **accessible, responsive, WCAG AA compliant**, and optimized for static hosting.
6. All animations must respect **prefers-reduced-motion**.

================================================================
📌 SITE STRUCTURE (partials)
- Home (hero, marquee highlights, blob dividers)
- About Us (story, capacity, team illustration)
- Sustainability (green energy, recycling, factory eco-illustrations)
- Certifications (grid with icons + glowing borders)
- Clients (logos carousel with futuristic glow)
- Impact Stories (case studies with tilt cards + textile/factory illustrations)
- Careers (job listings, futuristic workspace illustration)
- News (auto-loaded feed, illustrated “newsroom” background)
- Contact (form with confetti, Bangladesh map illustration)
- RFQ (request form with futuristic textile schematic background)
- Investors (mini glowing line chart + gooey button group)
- Privacy, Terms

================================================================
📌 ILLUSTRATION / BACKGROUND RECOMMENDATIONS
For each section, also **output illustration prompts** (ready for MidJourney/Leonardo):

📌 TECH RULES
- No React, no frameworks — only Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.

  ./scripts/main.js  
  ./scripts/router.js  
  ./scripts/stocks.js  
  ./partials/*.html (all pages above)  
  ./scripts/config.js (from env vars)  
- Include asset placeholders like `<img src="assets/about-illustration.png" alt="...">`.
- Use semantic HTML + ARIA.
- Optimize for static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, S3).

================================================================
📌 DELIVERABLE FORMAT
For each file:  
=== FILE: path/to/file ===  
<full content>

After all files, output a section titled **🎨 Illustration Prompts** with the exact asset generation prompts (for MidJourney/Leonardo).
